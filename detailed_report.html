                <p>The dataset consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Courses:</strong> 75</li>

                    <li><strong>Student Requests:</strong> Student course requests including priorities</li>
                    <li><strong>Rules:</strong> Scheduling rules extracted from the RULES sheet</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Rules Analysis</h2>
                <p>The following scheduling rules were identified from the dataset:</p>
                <ul>
        <li><strong>Rule 1:</strong> The  has N number of blocks - namely : ["1A","1B","2A","2B","3","4A","4B"]</li>
<li><strong>Rule 2:</strong> Blocks refer to fixed time periods or chunks of time during the  day when specific classes or activities are scheduled. Unlike traditional period-based systems (common in countries like India, where t...</li>
<li><strong>Rule 3:</strong> No teacher can be present twice in same block</li>
<li><strong>Rule 4:</strong> No student can be present twice in same block</li>
<li><strong>Rule 5:</strong> You need to assign student to section of the requested course in a particular block so that we 
maximize the number of resolutions of students requests received</li>
<li><strong>Rule 6:</strong> Students of different year can be assigned to same sections if they have requested for the same course </li>
<li><strong>Rule 7:</strong> No sections should be overcrowded - distribute the course requested students almost equally across the available sections of that particular course</li>
<li><strong>Rule 8:</strong> "Required" > "Requested" > "Recommended", 
this is the order of priority of requests, treat it as P1, P2, P3 </li>
<li><strong>Rule 9:</strong> Available blocks & Unavailable blocks columns in Course list are exactly what they sound like, you can schedule sections of those courses only in one of the blocks available in `Available Blocks` list...</li>
<li><strong>Rule 10:</strong> Length / Course Length (1 = One Term, 2 = Full Year) / Credits determine if the course will run for the entire year or Half a year </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    This analysis provides a structured view of the course scheduling data, including validation of key metrics,
                    identification of potential issues, and extraction of scheduling rules. The data has been cleaned and 
                    structured to facilitate further scheduling optimizations.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Based on the analysis, we can identify scheduling constraints, course demand patterns, and potential 
                    capacity issues that need to be addressed in the scheduling process.
